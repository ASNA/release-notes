<h2 id="installation-notes">Installation Notes</h2>
<p>Only one installation of Visual RPG, Windows Deployment, or DataGate WebPak may be installed on a single machine. The Windows Deployment and WebPak components are subsets of what is
contained in the AVR installation package.</p>
<p>ASNA Wings is composed of several items, some of them are used exclusively at design time, others at design and run time, there are items installed on the Windows machines and there
are others installed on the IBM i.</p>
<p>These are the ASNA components used at design time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wings Design Aid 10.0 (WDA). The WDA package includes DataGate client, Terminal Emulation support, Wings support and Visual RPG support.</li>
<li>DataGate 16.0 for IBM i (includes the Wings Handler).</li>
<li>ASNA Monarch Collector 3.1.</li>
</ul>
<p>For run time, the ASNA components needed are:</p>
<ul>
<li>DataGate WebPak (includes DataGate client, Terminal Emulation support, Wings support and Visual RPG support)</li>
<li>DataGate 16.0 for IBM i (includes the Wings Handler)</li>
</ul>
<p>The download packages on this page include the components for WDA, Monarch Collector and WebPak. The downloadable package for DataGate 16.0 for IBM i can be found <a href="https://asna.com/us/tech/downloads">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="silent-installation-process">Silent Installation Process</h3>
<p>Wings supports silent installations. See the Installation section of the <a href="https://docs.asna.com/documentation/Help160/Readmes/Wings_100_Readme.htm">Readme</a> file for more detail.</p>
<h3 id="licenses-needed-for-asna-wings">Licenses Needed for ASNA Wings</h3>
<p>ASNA Wings requires license keys on the Windows and IBM i machines.</p>
<p>On the developer Windows machine apply these license keys (Using the Registration Assistant):</p>
<ul>
<li>Wings Design Aid 10.0 (Look under Monarch on the Registration Assistant tree)</li>
</ul>
<p>On the IBM i, use the following commands to apply these license keys:</p>
<ul>
<li>DataGate 16.0 for IBM i
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;DataGate_installation_library&gt;/REGISTER LICENSE(*SRVR)</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wings Handler
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;DataGate_installation_library&gt;/REGISTER LICENSE(*WNGS)</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limitations-of-10.0">Limitations of 10.0</h3>
<p>This version of Wings has the following limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not install ASNA Wings 10.0 on a machine which has installed AVR or DG versions of 6.2 or earlier. Wings 10.0 can coexist with versions in the 16.0/10.0 family.
<br><span style="font-size: .6rem; color: gray;">16-10-wings-info.md</span><br></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="net-framework-and-visual-studio">.NET Framework and Visual Studio</h2>
<p>All ASNA .NET Framework products need .NET 4.8x.</p>
<p>For Visual RPG, Wings, Mobile RPG, etc, you'll need Visual Studio 2019 Professional Edition or Enterprise Edition. The Visual Studio Community Edition no longer works with ASNA products.</p>
<p>Also, please make sure your target machine is current with Windows updates.
<br><span style="font-size: .6rem; color: gray;">16-10-client-requirements.md</span><br></p>
<h2 id="differences-in-file-format-level-identifiers">Differences in File Format Level Identifiers</h2>
<p>There are several display file features that are handled differently in Wings than on the IBM i with respect to the layout of certain fields in record formats, this differences cause the Format Level Identifiers used in Level Checks to be different for files exported by Wings and those created directly from pure DDS. The normal development cycle for Wings ensures that these differences do not cause any problems. This cycle follows these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Import Display File DDS into Visual Studio</li>
<li>Optionally make modifications to the ASPX file created</li>
<li>Export the ASPX back to the IBM i onto a library for Wings exported Display Files</li>
<li>Add the HANDLER keyword to the RPG ILE program that will use the new ASPX as a workstation file</li>
<li>Compile the RPG ILE program ensuring the exported Display Files library is found first in the library list by the RPG compiler</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of the DDS features that cause Wings to generate different Format Level Identifiers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The usage of fields for row/col on the WINDOW keyword.</li>
<li>Using a field for the WNDTITLE keyword.</li>
<li>On Subfile Controller formats used on message subfiles, using the SFLPGMQ keyword on a field other than the first one of the format.

<h2 id="net-framework-and-visual-studio-1">.NET Framework and Visual Studio</h2>
<p>All ASNA .NET Framework products need .NET 4.8x.</p>
<p>For Visual RPG, Wings, Mobile RPG, etc, you'll need Visual Studio 2019 Professional Edition or Enterprise Edition. The Visual Studio Community Edition no longer works with ASNA products.</p>

<br><span style="font-size: .6rem; color: gray;">16-10-client-requirements.md</span><br></p>
<h2 id="asna-runtime-changes">ASNA Runtime Changes</h2>
<p>Starting with the version 15.0 of the ASNA family of .NET products two changes were introduced to some ASNA DLLs. If you are upgrading to 15.x or higher from a previous release ASNA family release the following may apply to you.</p>
<h3 id="asna.visualrpg.runtime.dll-expands-into-three-new-dlls">1. ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.DLL expands into three new DLLs</h3>
<p>The first change is that ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.DLL expands into three new DLLS:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASNA.Runtime.DLL</li>
<li>ASNA.Runtime.Support.DLL</li>
<li>ASNA.Runtime.Monarch.DLL</li>
</ul>
<p>This increased granularity was made to better match library improvements and DLL changes to the various ASNA products that use them. The details of this three-way split are shown below in Figure 1.</p>
<p><img src="https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/asna-assets/images/version15.x-dll-changes.png" alt="DLL changes introduced with ASNA Visual RPG for .NET Framework 15" /></p>
<p>In Figure 1 above the namespaces each DLL provides are shown prefixed with . They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASNA.Monarch</li>
<li>ASNA.Monarch.Wings</li>
<li>ASNA.Runtime</li>
<li>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see that although ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll has been split into three DLLs the same namespaces are provided in the new DLLs. The version 15.x DLLs also provided a few new additional namespaces beyond what's shown in Figure 1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To maintain backwards compatibility of version 15.0 with previous versions we ship an <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll</code> library which forwards requests for any of the four original namespaces that where in that DLL to the corresponding new DLL. We will stop shipping the <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll</code> with the next major version of ASNA .NET products. This forwarding version of this DLL will be available as a separate download.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="asna.visualrpg.common.sgml.dll-has-been-deprecated">2. ASNA.VisualRPG.Common.Sgml.dll has been deprecated.</h3>
<p>The second change is that <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Common.Sgml.dll</code> has been deprecated and its code has been moved to <code>ASNA.Runtime.dll</code>. This change mostly affects customers using Mobile RPG and Wings.</p>
<h3 id="changes-you-need-to-make-because-of-these-dll-changes">Changes you need to make because of these DLL changes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There are <em>no</em> coding changes you need to make in your projects because of these changes. The only changes you need to make is adding and/or deleting references. For new 15.x projects the correct project references will already exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>For <strong>all project types</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Remove references to <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Common.Sgml.dll</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to removing that reference:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For <strong>Visual RPG Windows and Web projects</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the reference to <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.dll</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For <strong>Wings</strong> and <strong>MobileRPG</strong> projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the reference to <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.JobSupport.dll</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For <strong>Monarch</strong> projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the reference to <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.JobSupport.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.Monarch.dll</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The ASNA.Runtime.* DLLS are located at:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\ASNA Shared\Client\xx
</code></pre>
<p>where xx is the ASNA Visual RPG version number.</p>

<h2 id="visual-studio-local-help-installation">Visual Studio local help installation</h2>
<p>Visual Studio treats local (offline) as an optional component. As such installing it requires <a href="https://docs.asna.com/documentation/Help150/Readmes/Help150VisualStudioWorkloads.htm">some additional steps</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The note above applies to any version of Visual Studio.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When installing Visual Studio:</p>
<ol>
<li>Under the Individual Components tab.</li>
<li>On the Code Tools section.</li>
<li>Enable the Help Viewer component.</li>
</ol>
<p>To verify the Help Viewer is installed, look at the top of the Help Menu in Visual Studio. The following three options should be visible at the top of the menu:</p>
<ol>
<li>View Help</li>
<li>Add and Remove Help Content</li>
<li>Set Help Preferences
<br><span style="font-size: .6rem; color: gray;">visual-studio-local-help.md</span><br></li>
