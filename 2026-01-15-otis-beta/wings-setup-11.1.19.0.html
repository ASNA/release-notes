<h1 id="asna-wings-release-notes">ASNA Wings release notes</h1>
<p>Version: 11.1.19.0 - Beta</p>
<p>Release date: 2026-01-15</p>
<div style="display: inline-block; background-color: pink; padding-block: .6rem; padding-inline: .8rem;">
<h2 id="effective-with-wings-11.1-mobile-rpg-is-now-packaged-with-wings">Effective with Wings 11.1 Mobile RPG is now packaged with Wings</h2>
<p>This means that if you are using Mobile RPG, after 11.1 you need to download Wings, not Mobile RPG.</p>
<p>The Mobile RPG features in Wings 11.1 do not require ASNA Go nor will ASNA Go be available after June 30th, 2025. When ASNA Go was introduced it provided features that were not available natively in browsers. However, browsers have matured so that they now natively perform the tasks that once required ASNA Go. We don't anticipate any coding changes needed to swap out ASNA Go for the native mobile features in Mobile RPG 11.1 packaged with Wings.</p>

<p>See the <a href="#platforms">Software Requirements section below</a> for platform support.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier version of Wings, you may be effected by the changes to the ASNA Runtime (see <strong>ASNA Runtime Changes</strong> below).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Be sure to read about the IBM i System Value requirements below.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ensure neither Visual Studio, its installation, nor any Visual Studio update is running at the time of Wings installation, as it may cause conflicts.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="net-framework-and-visual-studio">.NET Framework and Visual Studio</h2>
<p>All ASNA .NET Framework products need .NET 4.8x.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using Wings with Razor pages requires .NET 8+.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Visual RPG, Wings, etc, you'll need Visual Studio 2022 Professional Edition or Enterprise Edition. The Visual Studio Community Edition no longer works with ASNA products.

<h2 id="special-action-required-when-updating.net-aka.net-core">Special action required when updating .NET (aka .NET Core)</h2>
<p>The following notice is for customers using Wings 11.1 to produce Razor pages. It does not apply to customers using Wings 11.1 with .NET Framework's WebForms.</p>
<p>If you update .NET (aka .NET Core) you need to uninstall/reinstall Encore 4.0, and Cocoon 11.4, and Wings 11.1 if they are installed. NET can be updated directly or through a Visual Studio update. We require this because in order for the SDK to resolve properly and the templates to be available to all users, we must install certain files to versioned
<code>dotnet</code> directories (currently <code>C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk\[version]</code> and <code>C:\Program Files\dotnet\templates\[version]</code>). When the repair is performed, we re-install these components to the updated version directories.</p>
<h2 id="installation-notes">Installation Notes</h2>
<p>Only one installation of Visual RPG, Windows Deployment, or DataGate WebPak may be installed on a single machine. The Windows Deployment and WebPak components are subsets of what is
contained in the AVR installation package.</p>
<p>ASNA Wings is composed of several items, some of them are used exclusively at design time, others at design and run time, there are items installed on the Windows machines and there
are others installed on the IBM i.</p>
<p>These are the ASNA components used at design time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wings Design Aid 10.0 (WDA). The WDA package includes DataGate client, Terminal Emulation support, Wings support and Visual RPG support.</li>
<li>DataGate 16.0 for IBM i (includes the Wings Handler).</li>
<li>ASNA Monarch Collector 3.1.</li>
</ul>
<p>For run time, the ASNA components needed are:</p>
<ul>
<li>DataGate WebPak (includes DataGate client, Terminal Emulation support, Wings support and Visual RPG support)</li>
<li>DataGate 17.0 for IBM i (includes the Wings Handler)</li>
</ul>
<p>The download packages on this page include the components for WDA, Monarch Collector and WebPak. The downloadable package for DataGate 16.0 for IBM i can be found <a href="https://asna.com/us/tech/downloads">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="silent-installation-process">Silent Installation Process</h3>
<p>Wings supports silent installations. See the Installation section of the <a href="https://docs.asna.com/documentation/Help160/Readmes/Wings_100_Readme.htm">Readme</a> file for more detail.</p>
<p>{% include 'dot-net-runtime-changes.md'%}</p>
<h3 id="limitations-of-10.0">Limitations of 10.0</h3>
<p>This version of Wings has the following limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not install ASNA Wings 11.1 on a machine which has installed AVR or DG versions of 6.2 or earlier. Wings 10.0 can coexist with versions in the 16.0/10.0 family.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="required-ibm-i-configuration-for-wings">Required IBM i configuration for Wings</h3>
<p>Display files imported with the Wings Design Aid run in batch mode on the IBM i and require no specific SYSVAL settings. However, virtually all Wings installations will need to use the ASNA Terminal Emulator. Using the Emulator with Wings requires these IBM i SYSVAL settings:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>QMLTTHDACN: <strong>1</strong> or <strong>2</strong></li>
<li>QRMTSIGN: <strong>*VERIFY</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="limitations-of-ibm-rational-open-access-rpg-edition">Limitations of IBM Rational Open Access - RPG Edition</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The IBM i Open Access Handler limits language support ILE RPG (RPGIV) only. All other languages are excluded at this time, including CL.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An Open-Access file cannot be a program-described WORKSTN file.</p>

<h4 id="differences-in-format-level-identifiers">Differences in Format Level Identifiers</h4>
<p>There are several display file features that are handled differently in Wings than on the IBM i with respect to the layout of certain fields in record formats, this differences cause the Format Level Identifiers used in Level Checks to be different for files exported by Wings and those created directly from pure DDS. The normal development cycle for Wings ensures that these differences do not cause any problems. This cycle follows these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Import Display File DDS into Visual Studio</li>
<li>Optionally make modifications to the ASPX file created</li>
<li>Export the ASPX back to the IBM i onto a library for Wings exported Display Files</li>
<li>Add the HANDLER keyword to the RPG ILE program that will use the new ASPX as a workstation file</li>
<li>Compile the RPG ILE program ensuring the exported Display Files library is found first in the library list by the RPG compiler</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of the DDS features that cause Wings to generate different Format Level Identifiers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The usage of fields for row/col on the WINDOW keyword.</li>
<li>Using a field for the WNDTITLE keyword.</li>
<li>On Subfile Controller formats used on message subfiles, using the SFLPGMQ keyword on a field other than the first one of the format.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="visual-studio-local-help-installation">Visual Studio local help installation</h2>
<p>Visual Studio treats local (offline) as an optional component. As such installing it requires <a href="https://docs.asna.com/documentation/Help150/Readmes/Help150VisualStudioWorkloads.htm">some additional steps</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The note above applies to any version of Visual Studio.</p>

<p>When installing Visual Studio:</p>
<ol>
<li>Under the Individual Components tab.</li>
<li>On the Code Tools section.</li>
<li>Enable the Help Viewer component.</li>
</ol>
<p>To verify the Help Viewer is installed, look at the top of the Help Menu in Visual Studio. The following three options should be visible at the top of the menu:</p>
<ol>
<li>View Help</li>
<li>Add and Remove Help Content</li>
<li>Set Help Preferences

<h2 id="asna-runtime-changes">ASNA Runtime Changes</h2>
<p>Starting with the version 15.0 of the ASNA family of .NET products two changes were introduced to some ASNA DLLs. If you are upgrading to 15.x or higher from a previous release ASNA family release the following may apply to you.</p>
<h3 id="asna.visualrpg.runtime.dll-expands-into-three-new-dlls">1. ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.DLL expands into three new DLLs</h3>
<p>The first change is that ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.DLL expands into three new DLLS:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASNA.Runtime.DLL</li>
<li>ASNA.Runtime.Support.DLL</li>
<li>ASNA.Runtime.Monarch.DLL</li>
</ul>
<p>This increased granularity was made to better match library improvements and DLL changes to the various ASNA products that use them. The details of this three-way split are shown below in Figure 1.</p>
<p><img src="https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/asna-assets/images/version15.x-dll-changes.png" alt="DLL changes introduced with ASNA Visual RPG for .NET Framework 15" /></p>
<p>In Figure 1 above the namespaces each DLL provides are shown prefixed with . They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASNA.Monarch</li>
<li>ASNA.Monarch.Wings</li>
<li>ASNA.Runtime</li>
<li>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see that although ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll has been split into three DLLs the same namespaces are provided in the new DLLs. The version 15.x DLLs also provided a few new additional namespaces beyond what's shown in Figure 1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To maintain backwards compatibility of version 15.0 with previous versions we ship an <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll</code> library which forwards requests for any of the four original namespaces that where in that DLL to the corresponding new DLL. We will stop shipping the <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll</code> with the next major version of ASNA .NET products. This forwarding version of this DLL will be available as a separate download.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="asna.visualrpg.common.sgml.dll-has-been-deprecated">2. ASNA.VisualRPG.Common.Sgml.dll has been deprecated.</h3>
<p>The second change is that <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Common.Sgml.dll</code> has been deprecated and its code has been moved to <code>ASNA.Runtime.dll</code>. This change mostly affects customers using Mobile RPG and Wings.</p>
<h3 id="changes-you-need-to-make-because-of-these-dll-changes">Changes you need to make because of these DLL changes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There are <em>no</em> coding changes you need to make in your projects because of these changes. The only changes you need to make is adding and/or deleting references. For new 15.x projects the correct project references will already exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>For <strong>all project types</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Remove references to <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Common.Sgml.dll</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to removing that reference:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For <strong>Visual RPG Windows and Web projects</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the reference to <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.dll</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For <strong>Wings</strong> and <strong>MobileRPG</strong> projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the reference to <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.JobSupport.dll</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For <strong>Monarch</strong> projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the reference to <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.JobSupport.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.Monarch.dll</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The ASNA.Runtime.* DLLS are located at:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\ASNA Shared\Client\xx
</code></pre>
<p>where xx is the ASNA Visual RPG version number.</p>

<h2 id="secure-sockets-layer-ssl">Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</h2>
<p>The DataGate client software contained in this release significantly changes the way Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connections are configured. DataGate SSL support was introduced in Version 15 as an option for secure network communications between DataGate clients and servers.</p>
<p>In prior releases, DataGate client connection configurations, by default, specified an SSL-enabled connection. This allowed many users to enhance the security of their applications by simply installing the new, SSL supporting DataGate release. Unfortunately, other customers experienced connection and security issues due to shifting standards and evolving platform infrastructure supporting SSL, as offered by Windows and IBM i.</p>
<p>In this release, DataGate client users must now &quot;opt-in&quot; when configuring new connections secured with SSL. When a new connection configuration is created, the default setting is to specify a non-SSL, or &quot;clear-text&quot; connection to the server.</p>
<p>DataGate connections are typically configured as &quot;database names&quot;. A database name is a collection of properties defining all the information needed to connect to a DataGate server from the client computer. Existing database names are not affected by this change, but new database names are affected:</p>
<p>Database names created by prior releases retain the same SSL configuration as they had when created or modified.</p>
<p>The default configuration of new database names will specify non-SSL connections.</p>
<h3 id="creating-ssl-enabled-database-names">Creating SSL-Enabled Database Names</h3>
<p>Online documentation linked below fully details the process of creating an SSL-enabled database name configuration using DataGate Studio. The process is very similar for users of DataGate Monitor.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.asna.com/documentation/Help150/DataGate/SSL/_HTML/DataGateSSLClient.htm">Read more about DataGate's SSL support</a></p>
<h3 id="other-datagate-ssl-options">Other DataGate SSL Options</h3>
<p>DataGate offers many options for enhancing the security of its client/server connection with SSL. For full details of options available for both the client and server, please <a href="https://docs.asna.com/documentation/Help150/DataGate/SSL/_Helphome.htm">consult the online documentation.</a></p>
<h3 id="configuring-datagate-connections-programmatically">Configuring DataGate Connections Programmatically</h3>
<p>Connection configurations are represented in DataGate as instances of the SourceProfile class in the DataGate .NET API. While most users and applications will configure connections via database names, some programs use the DataGate API directly.</p>
<p>Users of the SourceProfile class are advised that the changes in this release may represent a <strong>breaking change</strong> to the behavior of your programs. The default value of the SourceProfile.SslOptions property is now SslOptions.None; in previous releases the default value was SslOptions.Request. If your program does not explicitly set this property, connections made with the SourceProfile instances you create will be clear-text, rather than SSL-enabled.</p>
<p>If you directly create and use SourceProfile instances in your programs, ASNA highly recommends modifying them to explicitly set SourceProfile.SslOptions before deploying this DataGate release.</p>
<h3 id="database-name-migration-from-non-ssl-releases">Database Name Migration From Non-SSL Releases</h3>
<p>Database names created by DataGate releases prior to Version 15 do not contain SSL-related configuration information. When these database names are read by Version 15 software, the configuration is migrated to include SSL configuration options. Prior to this release, those migrations would enable SSL connections, unless otherwise explicitly changed by the user. Henceforth, automatic database name migrations will disable SSL in the connections they represent.</p>
<p>Users who deploy applications using the database names contained in configuration files created with prior, non-SSL supported DataGate releases are advised that changes in this release may represent a <strong>breaking change</strong> in this deployment strategy, for reasons outlined in the previous paragraph.

<h2 id="downloading-with-microsoft-edge">Downloading with Microsoft Edge</h2>
<p>If this software is downloaded via Edge you may receive a message stating that this file &quot;is not commonly downloaded&quot; when attempting to install it. In this event click the <strong>View Downloads</strong> button, select the ASNA product to install from that list, and confirm that you'd like to install it.</p>
<p>Similarly, attempting to install the software directly through Microsoft Windows may cause a &quot;Windows protected your PC&quot; message to appear. In this event click the small <code>More Info</code> prompt on the left, and click <code>Run Anyway</code> on the following window.
