<h2 id="asna-runtime-changes">ASNA Runtime Changes</h2>
<p>Starting with the version 15.0 of the ASNA family of .NET products
two changes were introduced to some ASNA DLLs. If you are upgrading to
15.x or higher from a previous release ASNA family release the following
may apply to you.</p>
<h3 id="asna.visualrpg.runtime.dll-expands-into-three-new-dlls">1.
ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.DLL expands into three new DLLs</h3>
<p>The first change is that ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.DLL expands into
three new DLLS: * ASNA.Runtime.DLL * ASNA.Runtime.Support.DLL *
ASNA.Runtime.Monarch.DLL</p>
<p>This increased granularity was made to better match library
improvements and DLL changes to the various ASNA products that use them.
The details of this three-way split are shown below in Figure 1.</p>
<figure>
<img

alt="DLL changes introduced with ASNA Visual RPG for .NET Framework 15" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">DLL changes introduced with ASNA Visual
RPG for .NET Framework 15</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In Figure 1 above the namespaces each DLL provides are shown prefixed
with {}. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASNA.Monarch</li>
<li>ASNA.Monarch.Wings</li>
<li>ASNA.Runtime</li>
<li>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see that although ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll has been split
into three DLLs the same namespaces are provided in the new DLLs. The
version 15.x DLLs also provided a few new additional namespaces beyond
what’s shown in Figure 1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To maintain backwards compatibility of version 15.0 with previous
versions we ship an <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll</code> library
which forwards requests for any of the four original namespaces that
where in that DLL to the corresponding new DLL. We will stop shipping
the <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll</code> with the next major version
of ASNA .NET products. This forwarding version of this DLL will be
available as a separate download.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="asna.visualrpg.common.sgml.dll-has-been-deprecated.">2.
ASNA.VisualRPG.Common.Sgml.dll has been deprecated.</h3>
<p>The second change is that <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Common.Sgml.dll</code>
has been deprecated and its code has been moved to
<code>ASNA.Runtime.dll</code>. This change mostly affects customers
using Mobile RPG and Wings.</p>
<h3 id="changes-you-need-to-make-because-of-these-dll-changes">Changes
you need to make because of these DLL changes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There are <em>no</em> coding changes you need to make in your
projects because of these changes. The only changes you need to make is
adding and/or deleting references. For new 15.x projects the correct
project references will already exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>For <strong>all project types</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Remove references to
<code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Common.Sgml.dll</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to removing that reference:</p>
<ul>
<li>For <strong>Visual RPG Windows and Web projects</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Remove the reference to <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.dll</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>For <strong>Wings</strong> and <strong>MobileRPG</strong> projects:
<ul>
<li>Remove the reference to <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.JobSupport.dll</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>For <strong>Monarch</strong> projects:
<ul>
<li>Remove the reference to <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.JobSupport.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.Monarch.dll</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The ASNA.Runtime.* DLLS are located at:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\ASNA Shared\Client\xx</code></pre>
<p>where xx is the ASNA Visual RPG version number.</p>

<h2 id="supported-web-browsers-smartphones-and-tablets">Supported Web
browsers, smartphones, and tablets</h2>
<p>Please see <a
href="https://www.asna.com/en/kb/browsers-supported">this asna.com
article</a> for ASNA’s browser and mobile client support.</p>
<h2 id="database-name-change">Database Name change</h2>
<p>DataGate 17 features secure database name storage using Windows
DPAPI.ASNA has always recommended using <code>*PUBLIC</code> database
names for websites. In v17, we further recommend always using the
<code>*Public</code> prefix explicitly when referencing database names
in website applications, including Monarch. Otherwise, applications may
encounter run-time exceptions that include phrases such as “user profile
not loaded” when Windows DPAPI is used in IIS sessions running with
anonymous or impersonated credentials.</p>
<p>For example, an AVR-based website might have code similar to the
following, which references a DG database name in a DCLDB statement as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>DclDB Name(MyDatabase) DBName(&quot;IBMSERVER&quot;) Access(*Public)</code></pre>
<p>We strongly recommend changing this statement as shown below:</p>
<pre><code>DclDB Name(MyDatabase) DBName(&quot;*Public/IBMSERVER&quot;) Access(*Public)</code></pre>
<p>If changing existing code is impractical, the only way to avoid
errors is to ensure that the configuration of the IIS application pool
in which the website runs includes the setting “Load User Profile =
True”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that this setting may reduce the performance of large-scale
website applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Configuring IIS is Windows- and version-dependent, but generally
follows this set of steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open IIS Manager.</li>
<li>Under the Application Pools node, select the Application Pool that
the website runs under.</li>
<li>On the right-hand panel, select “Advanced Settings…”. A property
dialog appears.</li>
<li>Scroll to the Load User Profile setting, and ensure that it is set
to True.</li>
<li>Restart IIS.</li>
</ol>
<p>Websites may produce “user profile not loaded” exceptions mentioned
in the release Notes, even when database names are referenced with the
recommended “*Public/” prefix. If so, you must configure the “Load User
Profile = True” IIS Application Pool setting (also mentioned in the
Release Notes) as a workaround. It is highly recommended to remove this
workaround when you install the release of DataGate.</p>
<h2 id="secure-sockets-layer-ssl">Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</h2>
<p>The DataGate client software contained in this release significantly
changes the way Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connections are configured.
DataGate SSL support was introduced in Version 15 as an option for
secure network communications between DataGate clients and servers.</p>
<p>In prior releases, DataGate client connection configurations, by
default, specified an SSL-enabled connection. This allowed many users to
enhance the security of their applications by simply installing the new,
SSL supporting DataGate release. Unfortunately, other customers
experienced connection and security issues due to shifting standards and
evolving platform infrastructure supporting SSL, as offered by Windows
and IBM i.</p>
<p>In this release, DataGate client users must now “opt-in” when
configuring new connections secured with SSL. When a new connection
configuration is created, the default setting is to specify a non-SSL,
or “clear-text” connection to the server.</p>
<p>DataGate connections are typically configured as “database names”. A
database name is a collection of properties defining all the information
needed to connect to a DataGate server from the client computer.
Existing database names are not affected by this change, but new
database names are affected:</p>
<p>Database names created by prior releases retain the same SSL
configuration as they had when created or modified.</p>
<p>The default configuration of new database names will specify non-SSL
connections.</p>
<h3 id="creating-ssl-enabled-database-names">Creating SSL-Enabled
Database Names</h3>
<p>Online documentation linked below fully details the process of
creating an SSL-enabled database name configuration using DataGate
Studio. The process is very similar for users of DataGate Monitor.</p>
<p><a
href="https://docs.asna.com/documentation/Help150/DataGate/SSL/_HTML/DataGateSSLClient.htm">Read
more about DataGate’s SSL support</a></p>
<h3 id="other-datagate-ssl-options">Other DataGate SSL Options</h3>
<p>DataGate offers many options for enhancing the security of its
client/server connection with SSL. For full details of options available
for both the client and server, please <a
href="https://docs.asna.com/documentation/Help150/DataGate/SSL/_Helphome.htm">consult
the online documentation.</a></p>
<h3 id="configuring-datagate-connections-programmatically">Configuring
DataGate Connections Programmatically</h3>
<p>Connection configurations are represented in DataGate as instances of
the SourceProfile class in the DataGate .NET API. While most users and
applications will configure connections via database names, some
programs use the DataGate API directly.</p>
<p>Users of the SourceProfile class are advised that the changes in this
release may represent a <strong>breaking change</strong> to the behavior
of your programs. The default value of the SourceProfile.SslOptions
property is now SslOptions.None; in previous releases the default value
was SslOptions.Request. If your program does not explicitly set this
property, connections made with the SourceProfile instances you create
will be clear-text, rather than SSL-enabled.</p>
<p>If you directly create and use SourceProfile instances in your
programs, ASNA highly recommends modifying them to explicitly set
SourceProfile.SslOptions before deploying this DataGate release.</p>
<h3 id="database-name-migration-from-non-ssl-releases">Database Name
Migration From Non-SSL Releases</h3>
<p>Database names created by DataGate releases prior to Version 15 do
not contain SSL-related configuration information. When these database
names are read by Version 15 software, the configuration is migrated to
include SSL configuration options. Prior to this release, those
migrations would enable SSL connections, unless otherwise explicitly
changed by the user. Henceforth, automatic database name migrations will
disable SSL in the connections they represent.</p>
<p>Users who deploy applications using the database names contained in
configuration files created with prior, non-SSL supported DataGate
releases are advised that changes in this release may represent a
<strong>breaking change</strong> in this deployment strategy, for
reasons outlined in the previous paragraph.</p>
<h2 id="downloading-with-microsoft-edge">Downloading with Microsoft
Edge</h2>
<p>If this software is downloaded via Edge you may receive a message
stating that this file “is not commonly downloaded” when attempting to
install it. In this event click the <strong>View Downloads</strong>
button, select the ASNA product to install from that list, and confirm
that you’d like to install it.</p>
<p>Similarly, attempting to install the software directly through
Microsoft Windows may cause a “Windows protected your PC” message to
appear. In this event click the small <code>More Info</code> prompt on
the left, and click <code>Run Anyway</code> on the following window.</p>
<h2 id="ibm-i-open-access-handlers">IBM i Open Access Handlers</h2>
