<h1 id="datagate-studio-release-notes">DataGate Studio release notes</h1>
<p>Version: 17.1.19.0 - GA</p>
<p>Release date: 2025-12-02</p>
<hr />
<p>The DataGate Explorer fulfills a somewhat specialized need, but when you do need it it is very handy.</p>
<p>When you install ASNA Visual RPG on a PC (which needs to have had Visual Studio installed prior), the ASNA DataGate Explorer implicitly installed in Visual Studio. This lets you work databases, doing such things as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create, delete, and modify DataGate Database Names</li>
<li>Add files, change files, and delete files (including logical files)</li>
<li>Browse file contents</li>
<li>Import and export database artifacts to DGIE files</li>
</ul>
<p>Long-time ASNA users will recognize that these capabilities make the ASNA DataGate Explorer analogous to the old COM Database Manager.</p>
<h2 id="the-datagate-explorers-special-use-case">The DataGate Explorer's special use case</h2>
<p>Packaging and installing the DataGate Explorer with ASNA Visual is great for programmers, but not so much for DB administrators. For example, administrators may need to work with databases on Windows Server, but don't want to install (and license) ASNA Visual RPG. To resolve this, after installing Visual Studio on the the Windows Server, installing ASNA DataGate Studio installs the DataGate Explorer in that Visual Studio instance.</p>
<p>The DataGate Studio does need a license key.</p>
