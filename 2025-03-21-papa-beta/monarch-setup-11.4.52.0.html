<h2 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h2>
<h3 id="datagate-studio">DataGate Studio</h3>
<ul>
<li>File definition wizard for SQL Logical files crashes Visual Studio.
Workaround: The crash can be avoided if DataGate Explorer connections
used in the wizard dialogs are first opened in the DataGate Explorer
window.</li>
<li>New connections are not found by DataGate Studio controls.
Workaround: To avoid this error, restart the DG Studio IDE before using
newly-added connections.</li>
<li>DataGate File Definition Projects: The “New -&gt; Project…” command
is changed in Visual Studio 2019 with a wizard-like dialog, allowing you
to filter languages, platforms, and other criteria. In this release,
DataGate projects are not listed as available project types via the
filter drop-down selection mechanism.<br />
To access DataGate projects, enter the word “DataGate” in the search box
to the right of the “Create a new project” banner on the dialog
page.<br />
The available Datagate project templates (possibly among other
irrelevant templates) should appear in the list below the filter
selections.<br />
Select the DataGate template of choice and click “Next”.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="web-controls-1">Web Controls</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Monarch Display File with a subfile where DblClickTargetValue
DdsSubfileControl’s property is used on a field indicated by
dblClickTargetField where the corresponding subfile field is of
InputStyle=“CheckBox” does not get its CheckedValue when the record in
the subfile is double-clicked.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shared-components">Shared components</h2>
<p>ASNA Monarch 10.0, ASNA Wings 10.0 and ASNA Mobile RPG 10.0 share
some components to produce their user interface. These components are
distributed with AVR and WebPak 16.0. The shared components are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Monarch Server Controls (i.e.: DdsRecord, DdsCharField, DdsChart
…)</li>
<li>The ASNA 5250 Terminal Emulator</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="installation-notes">Installation Notes</h3>
<p>Monarch 10.0 can be installed on a machine with the previous version
(Monarch 9.0) if so desired. Any earlier products may cause conflicts if
you have installed other ASNA products from our 14.0 and 8.0 product
families (e.g. Visual RPG 14.0, Wings 8.0), please remove them prior to
installation, or upgrade them before or after upgrading to Monarch
10.0.</p>
<p>ASNA Monarch 10.0 may be installed as a stand-alone product, or it
may be installed along side ASNA Visual RPG 16.0. ASNA Monarch 10.0 is
not compatible with ASNA Visual RPG 14.0 or earlier. Please consider
upgrading to ASNA Visual RPG 16.0 before installing ASNA Monarch
10.0.</p>
<p>Installing Microsoft’s latest service packs, high priority and
optional software updates for Windows and the .NET Framework is highly
recommended.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3118401">Windows
optional update KB3118401 is required for correct operation of version
16.0.</a></p>
<h2 id="platform-support">Platform support</h2>
<p>See the <a
href="https://www.asna.com/en/support/product-requirements">ASNA Version
Policy</a> for full requirements</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can only install one version of an ASNA Windows product on a
single PC. For example, you can’t install ASNA Visual RPG for .NET 17.0
on a PC on which ASNA Visual RPG for .NET 16.0 is installed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="general-installation-tips">General installation tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>We strongly recommend you apply all pending Windows updates
before installing any of our Windows products.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t install any ASNA Windows products while Visual Studio is
running.</p></li>
<li><p>For our products that snap into Visual Studio (ie, Visual RPG for
.NET Framework, Wings, Mobile RPG, etc.) be sure to install Visual
Studio first.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="supported-web-browsers-smartphones-and-tablets">Supported Web
browsers, smartphones, and tablets</h2>
<p>Please see <a
href="https://www.asna.com/en/kb/browsers-supported">this asna.com
article</a> for ASNA’s browser and mobile client support.</p>
<h2 id="database-name-change">Database Name change</h2>
<p>DataGate 17 features secure database name storage using Windows
DPAPI.ASNA has always recommended using <code>*PUBLIC</code> database
names for websites. In v17, we further recommend always using the
<code>*Public</code> prefix explicitly when referencing database names
in website applications, including Monarch. Otherwise, applications may
encounter run-time exceptions that include phrases such as “user profile
not loaded” when Windows DPAPI is used in IIS sessions running with
anonymous or impersonated credentials.</p>
<p>For example, an AVR-based website might have code similar to the
following, which references a DG database name in a DCLDB statement as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>DclDB Name(MyDatabase) DBName(&quot;IBMSERVER&quot;) Access(*Public)</code></pre>
<p>We strongly recommend changing this statement as shown below:</p>
<pre><code>DclDB Name(MyDatabase) DBName(&quot;*Public/IBMSERVER&quot;) Access(*Public)</code></pre>
<p>If changing existing code is impractical, the only way to avoid
errors is to ensure that the configuration of the IIS application pool
in which the website runs includes the setting “Load User Profile =
True”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that this setting may reduce the performance of large-scale
website applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Configuring IIS is Windows- and version-dependent, but generally
follows this set of steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open IIS Manager.</li>
<li>Under the Application Pools node, select the Application Pool that
the website runs under.</li>
<li>On the right-hand panel, select “Advanced Settings…”. A property
dialog appears.</li>
<li>Scroll to the Load User Profile setting, and ensure that it is set
to True.</li>
<li>Restart IIS.</li>
</ol>
<p>Websites may produce “user profile not loaded” exceptions mentioned
in the release Notes, even when database names are referenced with the
recommended “*Public/” prefix. If so, you must configure the “Load User
Profile = True” IIS Application Pool setting (also mentioned in the
Release Notes) as a workaround. It is highly recommended to remove this
workaround when you install the release of DataGate.</p>
<p>ASNA Monarch Cocoon also requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASNA Monarch Collector version 10.x - <a
href="http://docs.asna.com/documentation/Readme/Monarch41_Readme.htm#Installing_Collector">Installation
instructions for Monarch Collector can be found here.</a></li>

    <span class="changeNoteHeading">RnD - Cocoon Dotnet Templates</span>
    <ul>
        <li>Removed quotes in the CallD program name (to allow for possible /Error warning need of parameters.</li>
        <li>Remove the MessageFiles folder item group from the Template for the Website’s project file.</li>
    </ul>

    <span class="changeNoteHeading">Services</span>
    <ul>
        <li>Case 21749. This release removes the ASNA Assist Windows service distributed and installed in prior releases.  This service was deprecated in v15 products and only installed for users that may have still been dependent on prior release software. The service's only purpose was to support *DOMAIN authentication in DataGate connections in pre-DG v15 .NET client software. If, after installing this release, users experience DataGate connection authentication exceptions when using *DOMAIN, please contact ASNA for support.</li>
        <li>Case 21750. Enhance security.</li>
