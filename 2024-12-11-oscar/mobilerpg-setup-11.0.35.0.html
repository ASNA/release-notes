<p>See the <a href="#platforms">Software Requirements section below</a> for platform support.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier version of AVR, you may be effected by the changes to the ASNA Runtime (see <strong>ASNA Runtime Changes</strong> below).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="required-ibm-i-sysval-and-user-profile-setting-required-for-mobile-rpg">Required IBM i SYSVAL and User Profile setting required for Mobile RPG</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The following System Values are required:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>QMLTTHDACN</code>: <strong>1</strong> or <strong>2</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>ASNA Wings requires the <code>QRMTSIGN</code> IBM i system value to be set to <code>*VERIFY</code> to be able to use the ASNA Browser-based emulator. It is assumed that Mobile RPG will be used with new RPG programs and not need to invoke the ASNA emulator on mobile devices. Therefore, Mobile RPG doesn't require a given value in <code>QRMTSIGN</code>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="limitations-of-ibm-rational-open-access-rpg-edition">Limitations of IBM Rational Open Access - RPG Edition</h3>
<ul>
<li>Handler support limited to ILE RPG (RPGIV) only. All other languages are excluded at this time, including CL.</li>
<li>An Open-Access file cannot be a program-described WORKSTN file.</li>

<h2 id="platform-support">Platform support</h2>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.asna.com/en/support/product-requirements">ASNA Version Policy</a> for full requirements</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can only install one version of an ASNA Windows product on a single PC. For example, you can't install ASNA Visual RPG for .NET 17.0 on a PC on which ASNA Visual RPG for .NET 16.0 is installed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="general-installation-tips">General installation tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>We strongly recommend you apply all pending Windows updates before installing any of our Windows products.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don't install any ASNA Windows products while Visual Studio is running.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For our products that snap into Visual Studio (ie, Visual RPG for .NET Framework, Wings, Mobile RPG, etc.) be sure to install Visual Studio first.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="asna-runtime-changes">ASNA Runtime Changes</h2>
<p>Starting with the version 15.0 of the ASNA family of .NET products two changes were introduced to some ASNA DLLs. If you are upgrading to 15.x or higher from a previous release ASNA family release the following may apply to you.</p>
<h3 id="asna.visualrpg.runtime.dll-expands-into-three-new-dlls">1. ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.DLL expands into three new DLLs</h3>
<p>The first change is that ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.DLL expands into three new DLLS:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASNA.Runtime.DLL</li>
<li>ASNA.Runtime.Support.DLL</li>
<li>ASNA.Runtime.Monarch.DLL</li>
</ul>
<p>This increased granularity was made to better match library improvements and DLL changes to the various ASNA products that use them. The details of this three-way split are shown below in Figure 1.</p>
<p><img src="https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/asna-assets/images/version15.x-dll-changes.png" alt="DLL changes introduced with ASNA Visual RPG for .NET Framework 15" /></p>
<p>In Figure 1 above the namespaces each DLL provides are shown prefixed with . They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASNA.Monarch</li>
<li>ASNA.Monarch.Wings</li>
<li>ASNA.Runtime</li>
<li>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see that although ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll has been split into three DLLs the same namespaces are provided in the new DLLs. The version 15.x DLLs also provided a few new additional namespaces beyond what's shown in Figure 1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To maintain backwards compatibility of version 15.0 with previous versions we ship an <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll</code> library which forwards requests for any of the four original namespaces that where in that DLL to the corresponding new DLL. We will stop shipping the <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll</code> with the next major version of ASNA .NET products. This forwarding version of this DLL will be available as a separate download.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="asna.visualrpg.common.sgml.dll-has-been-deprecated">2. ASNA.VisualRPG.Common.Sgml.dll has been deprecated.</h3>
<p>The second change is that <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Common.Sgml.dll</code> has been deprecated and its code has been moved to <code>ASNA.Runtime.dll</code>. This change mostly affects customers using Mobile RPG and Wings.</p>
<h3 id="changes-you-need-to-make-because-of-these-dll-changes">Changes you need to make because of these DLL changes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There are <em>no</em> coding changes you need to make in your projects because of these changes. The only changes you need to make is adding and/or deleting references. For new 15.x projects the correct project references will already exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>For <strong>all project types</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Remove references to <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Common.Sgml.dll</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to removing that reference:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For <strong>Visual RPG Windows and Web projects</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the reference to <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.dll</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For <strong>Wings</strong> and <strong>MobileRPG</strong> projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the reference to <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.JobSupport.dll</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For <strong>Monarch</strong> projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the reference to <code>ASNA.VisualRPG.Runtime.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.JobSupport.dll</code></li>
<li>Add a reference to <code>ASNA.Runtime.Monarch.dll</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The ASNA.Runtime.* DLLS are located at:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\ASNA Shared\Client\xx
</code></pre>
<p>where xx is the ASNA Visual RPG version number.</p>

<h2 id="visual-studio-2022-editions">Visual Studio 2022 Editions</h2>
<p>Visual Studio 2022 17.4 or higher Professional or Enterprise edition is required with the Papa family.</p>
<h2 id="visual-studio-local-help-installation">Visual Studio local help installation</h2>
<p>Visual Studio 2022 treats local (offline) as an optional component. As such installing it requires <a href="https://docs.asna.com/documentation/Help150/Readmes/Help150VisualStudioWorkloads.htm">some additional steps</a>:</p>
<p>When installing Visual Studio 2019:</p>
<ol>
<li>Under the Individual Components tab.</li>
<li>On the Code Tools section.</li>
<li>Enable the Help Viewer component.</li>
</ol>
<p>To verify the Help Viewer is installed, look at the top of the Help Menu in Visual Studio. The following three options should be visible at the top of the menu:</p>
<ol>
<li>View Help</li>
<li>Add and Remove Help Content</li>
<li>Set Help Preferences</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="supported-web-browsers-smartphones-and-tablets">Supported Web browsers, smartphones, and tablets</h2>
<p>Please see <a href="https://www.asna.com/en/kb/browsers-supported">this asna.com article</a> for ASNA's browser and mobile client support.</p>
<h2 id="downloading-with-microsoft-edge">Downloading with Microsoft Edge</h2>
<p>If this software is downloaded via Edge you may receive a message stating that this file &quot;is not commonly downloaded&quot; when attempting to install it. In this event click the <strong>View Downloads</strong> button, select the ASNA product to install from that list, and confirm that you'd like to install it.</p>
<p>Similarly, attempting to install the software directly through Microsoft Windows may cause a &quot;Windows protected your PC&quot; message to appear. In this event click the small <code>More Info</code> prompt on the left, and click <code>Run Anyway</code> on the following window.</p>
<h2 id="ibm-i-open-access-handlers">IBM i Open Access Handlers</h2>
<p>DataGate for IBM i installs the following Open Access handlers:</p>
<ul>
<li>BTerm</li>
<li>Mobile RPG</li>
<li>WingsRPG</li>
<li>Wings Ext</li>
</ul>
<p>Each handler is licensed separately. Talk to your ASNA sales representative for licensing details.</p>
