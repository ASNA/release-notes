<blockquote>
<p>You can only install one version of an ASNA Windows product on a

<h2 id="general-installation-tips">General installation tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>We strongly recommend you apply all pending Windows updates
before installing any of our Windows products.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t install any ASNA Windows products while Visual Studio is
running.</p></li>
<li><p>For our products that snap into Visual Studio (ie, Visual RPG for
.NET Framework, Wings, Mobile RPG, etc.) be sure to install Visual
Studio first.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="secure-sockets-layer-ssl">Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</h2>
<p>The DataGate client software contained in this release significantly
changes the way Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connections are configured.
DataGate SSL support was introduced in Version 15 as an option for
secure network communications between DataGate clients and servers.</p>
<p>In prior releases, DataGate client connection configurations, by
default, specified an SSL-enabled connection. This allowed many users to
enhance the security of their applications by simply installing the new,
SSL supporting DataGate release. Unfortunately, other customers
experienced connection and security issues due to shifting standards and
evolving platform infrastructure supporting SSL, as offered by Windows
and IBM i.</p>
<p>In this release, DataGate client users must now “opt-in” when
configuring new connections secured with SSL. When a new connection
configuration is created, the default setting is to specify a non-SSL,
or “clear-text” connection to the server.</p>
<p>DataGate connections are typically configured as “database names”. A
database name is a collection of properties defining all the information
needed to connect to a DataGate server from the client computer.
Existing database names are not affected by this change, but new
database names are affected:</p>
<p>Database names created by prior releases retain the same SSL
configuration as they had when created or modified.</p>
<p>The default configuration of new database names will specify non-SSL
connections.</p>
<h3 id="creating-ssl-enabled-database-names">Creating SSL-Enabled
Database Names</h3>
<p>Online documentation linked below fully details the process of
creating an SSL-enabled database name configuration using DataGate
Studio. The process is very similar for users of DataGate Monitor.</p>
<p><a
href="https://docs.asna.com/documentation/Help150/DataGate/SSL/_HTML/DataGateSSLClient.htm">Read
more about DataGate’s SSL support</a></p>
<h3 id="other-datagate-ssl-options">Other DataGate SSL Options</h3>
<p>DataGate offers many options for enhancing the security of its
client/server connection with SSL. For full details of options available
for both the client and server, please <a
href="https://docs.asna.com/documentation/Help150/DataGate/SSL/_Helphome.htm">consult
the online documentation.</a></p>
<h3 id="configuring-datagate-connections-programmatically">Configuring
DataGate Connections Programmatically</h3>
<p>Connection configurations are represented in DataGate as instances of
the SourceProfile class in the DataGate .NET API. While most users and
applications will configure connections via database names, some
programs use the DataGate API directly.</p>
<p>Users of the SourceProfile class are advised that the changes in this
release may represent a <strong>breaking change</strong> to the behavior
of your programs. The default value of the SourceProfile.SslOptions
property is now SslOptions.None; in previous releases the default value
was SslOptions.Request. If your program does not explicitly set this
property, connections made with the SourceProfile instances you create
will be clear-text, rather than SSL-enabled.</p>
<p>If you directly create and use SourceProfile instances in your
programs, ASNA highly recommends modifying them to explicitly set
SourceProfile.SslOptions before deploying this DataGate release.</p>
<h3 id="database-name-migration-from-non-ssl-releases">Database Name
Migration From Non-SSL Releases</h3>
<p>Database names created by DataGate releases prior to Version 15 do
not contain SSL-related configuration information. When these database
names are read by Version 15 software, the configuration is migrated to
include SSL configuration options. Prior to this release, those
migrations would enable SSL connections, unless otherwise explicitly
changed by the user. Henceforth, automatic database name migrations will
disable SSL in the connections they represent.</p>
<p>Users who deploy applications using the database names contained in
configuration files created with prior, non-SSL supported DataGate
releases are advised that changes in this release may represent a
<strong>breaking change</strong> in this deployment strategy, for
reasons outlined in the previous paragraph.</p>
<h2 id="supported-web-browsers-smartphones-and-tablets">Supported Web
browsers, smartphones, and tablets</h2>
<p>Please see <a

article</a> for ASNA’s browser and mobile client support.</p>
<h2 id="downloading-with-microsoft-edge">Downloading with Microsoft
Edge</h2>
<p>If this software is downloaded via Edge you may receive a message
stating that this file “is not commonly downloaded” when attempting to
install it. In this event click the <strong>View Downloads</strong>
button, select the ASNA product to install from that list, and confirm
that you’d like to install it.</p>
<p>Similarly, attempting to install the software directly through
Microsoft Windows may cause a “Windows protected your PC” message to
appear. In this event click the small <code>More Info</code> prompt on
the left, and click <code>Run Anyway</code> on the following window.</p>
