<h1 id="asna-visual-rpg-classic-5.1-release-notes">ASNA Visual RPG Classic 5.1 release notes</h1>
<p>Version: 5.1.29.0 - GA</p>
<p>Release date: 2025-07-01</p>
<hr />
<p>This is the AVR Classic development package. It includes the Visual RPG 5.1 compiler and its integrated development environment. It is for use with Windows Professional 10 or 11.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that AVR Classic 5.1 <em>does not</em> coexist with other versions of AVR Classic. It does coexist with AVR for .NET.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="windows-updates">Windows updates</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It is very important that you install all Microsoft Windows updates before installing AVR 5.2 Classic.</p>

<h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>
<p>You'll need a license for this package. Please contact us at codes@asna.com for your license.</p>
<h2 id="third-party-controls">Third-party controls</h2>
<p>Our testing so far has been encouraging with most third-party controls on Windows 10/11. However, third-party controls do remain a potential concern with AVR 5.1. Their behavior is beyond our control so if they have issues there isn't anything we can do about those controls.</p>
<p>Customers using third-party controls will need to test their apps vigilantly. One of the sticky issues here is that the ActiveX vendor may be out of business. Mabry and Graphics Server are simply gone. Sheridan was bought by Component Source and they still sell the popular Sheridan ActiveThreed controls, but with a caveat on their Web page that says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Please note that this product is no longer supported by the publisher, so it is no longer eligible for product support or maintenance.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="graphics-server-control">Graphics Server control</h2>
<p>It has worked in our tests so far, but the AVR Classic graph control was licensed from Graphics Server and which is now out of business. It's quite likely that the graph control will continue to work with Windows 10/11 and the latest Windows Servers, but if it doesn't, you'll need to find a workable alternative.

<h2 id="platform-support">Platform support</h2>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.asna.com/en/support/product-requirements">ASNA Version Policy</a> for full requirements</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can only install one version of an ASNA Windows product on a single PC. For example, you can't install ASNA Visual RPG for .NET 17.0 on a PC on which ASNA Visual RPG for .NET 16.0 is installed.</p>
</blockquote>
